    "Ans: Expression is the combination of operators and operands.\n",
    "Types of Expressions:\n",
    "1. Arithmetic Expressions : It is a combination of operators, operands and also parenthesis is known as Arithmetic Expression.\n",
    "Eg: x = 3\n",
    "    y = 4\n",
    "add = x + y \n",
    "mult= x * y\n",
    "print(add)\n",
    "print(mult)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Constant Expressions: these are the expression that have constant values only\n",
    "eg: c = c = 8 + 10\n",
    "print(c)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Integral Expressions: These are the expressions that produce only integer results after all computations and type conversions\n",
    "EG: X=13\n",
    "    Y=12.3\n",
    "    C = X + int(Y)\n",
    "    print(C)\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Floating Expressions: These are the expressions which produce floating point numbers as result after all computations and type conversions.\n",
    "    Eg:\n",
    "  X=13\n",
    "  Y=2\n",
    "  C = X / Y\n",
    "  print(C)\n",
    "  \n",
    "5. Relational Expressions: In these types of expressions, arithmetic expressions are written on both sides of relational operator (> , < , >= , <=). Those arithmetic expressions are evaluated first, and then compared as per relational operator and produce a boolean output in the end.\n",
    "EG: \n",
    "x = 2\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "a = 6\n",
    "b = 8\n",
    "\n",
    "Sum = (x + y) > = (a + b)\n",
    "print(Sum)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Logical Expressions: These are kinds of expressions that result in either True or False. It basically specifies one or more conditions. For example, (10 == 9) is a condition if 10 is equal to 9. As we know it is not correct, so it will return False.\n",

    "print(d)\n",
    "\n",
    "e = not b\n",
    "print(e)\n",

    "7. Bitwise Expressions: These are the kind of expressions in which computations are performed at bit level.\n",

    "x = 10\n",
    "a = x >> 2\n",
